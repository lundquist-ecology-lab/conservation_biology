st.title("Understanding the Value of Species through Environmental Economics")

# Introduction
st.header("Introduction")
st.write("""
Environmental economics explores how to balance human activities with environmental preservation.
One key aspect is understanding the value of species â€“ not just in terms of monetary worth but also in their roles in ecosystems.

# Concept Explanation
st.header("Key Concepts")
st.write("""
Species provide various ecosystem services, including:
- **Provisioning services**: Products like food, fresh water, and medicinal resources.
- **Regulating services**: Climate regulation, water purification, and pest control.
- **Cultural services**: Recreational, spiritual, and aesthetic benefits.
- **Supporting services**: Nutrient cycling, soil formation, and pollination.

    st.write("Cost-Benefit Analysis compares the costs of conservation with the benefits derived from preserving species.")

# Case Study or Example

Consider the example of bees as pollinators. They are essential for agriculture, affecting the production of fruits and vegetables.
How would you value their contribution to the ecosystem and economy?

# Conclusion
st.header("Conclusion")

Understanding the value of species helps in making informed decisions that balance economic growth with conservation efforts.
Every species plays a unique role, and quantifying their value can support sustainable development.
