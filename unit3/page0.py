    Environmental economics explores how to balance human activities with environmental preservation.
    One key aspect is understanding the value of species â€“ not just in terms of monetary worth but also in their roles in ecosystems.

    Species provide various ecosystem services, including:
    - **Provisioning services**: Products like food, fresh water, and medicinal resources.
    - **Regulating services**: Climate regulation, water purification, and pest control.
    - **Cultural services**: Recreational, spiritual, and aesthetic benefits.
    - **Supporting services**: Nutrient cycling, soil formation, and pollination.
